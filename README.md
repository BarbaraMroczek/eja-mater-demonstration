This is a small git repository (13 commits) with Lily sources of a
choir part from 3rd movement of Antonin Dvorak's Stabat Mater.  I
think it's a very good example of LilyPond at work, problems with
default output, and the beautification progress itself, especially
that the commit history was specifically hand-crafted to show and
document each stage of beautification.
I think it could be an entertaining and informative demonstration to
show these commits with respective compiled scores to people in music
industry.  Using interactive git rebase you could even add some fake
typos inside :P
This engraving was created by me from a version used by my choir.  I
don't know what the original edition was, but i'm pretty sure that it
should be in public domain, so consider yourself free to use it under
the terms of GNU GPL 3 or higher. Feedback is welcome!
